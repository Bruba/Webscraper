The user is not prompted or required to supply a new password, although this capability is provided. Once the user supplies a new password, the factory default password is no longer valid.

In Schneider Electric’s testing on this issue, the communications module does in fact stop communicating when the connection limit is exceeded, but the PLC continues its control functions and its operation is unaffected. After the connection limit is exceeded, the communications module performs a soft reset. An attacker could not remotely exploit this observed behavior to deny PLC control functions.
