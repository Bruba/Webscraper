An independent research group composed of Nadia Heninger, (,, J. Alex Halderman, ,Zakir Durumeric, and ,Eric Wustrow (all from the University of Michi,gan), ,identified an ,insufficient entropy vulnerability, , ,in authentication key generation in the Post Oak AWAM Bluetooth Reader Traffic System. By impersonating the device, an attacker can obtain the credentials of administrative users and potentially perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. Post Oak has validated the vulnerability and produced an updated firmware version that mitigates the vulnerability. According to Post Oak, its products are deployed in the transportation sector, mainly in the United States. ,This vulnerability can be exploited remotely. ,The following Post Oak products are affected: ,An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the system by determining the authentication keys from reused or nonunique host keys. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can perform a MitM attack to affect the availability of the system and access data and settings. ,Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation. ,Post Oak Traffic Systems is a US-based company that specializes in low cost traffic monitoring in both freeway and arterial environments. Post Oak uses licensed patent pending technology developed by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, a transportation research organization. ,The affected products are Bluetooth wireless traffic monitoring systems. According to Post Oak, the product is deployed in the transportation sector. Post Oak estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States. ,The Post Oak AWAM Bluetooth Reader Traffic Systems does not use sufficient entropy when generating authentication and host keys. By calculating the private authentication keys, an attacker could perform a MitM attack on the system by knowing the nonunique host key. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system and read information on the device, as well as inject data compromising the integrity of the data. ,CVE-2012-4687,b, has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ,(AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C),.,This vulnerability could be exploited remotely. ,No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability ,An attacker with a high skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities. ,Post Oak has developed a patch for the AWAM Bluetooth Reader Traffic System that mitigates the vulnerability. The patch allows the Bluetooth reader to ensure sufficient entropy exists before generating host and authentication keys. The patch will be installed on all new devices when initially configured. Existing equipment will be patched by remote access and upgraded to the latest firmware. System owners are encouraged to contact, ,Post Oak Traffic Systems,c, with questions patching their systems. ,ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks. ,ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the US-CERT Web page.

Schneider Electric has already released a revision that eliminates this vulnerability. This advisory serves as a notification of a new vulnerability in the previous software version. The researchers have tested the revision to validate that it resolves the reported vulnerability.,IEEE 802 specifies that packets have a minimum size of 56 bytes. The Ethernet driver is expected to fill the data field with octets of zero for padding when packets are less than 56 bytes. Resident memory and other data are used for padding in some implementations that could cause information leakage. This attack is passive; the attacker can only see data that the affected device sent out as part of a packet.,,"All information products included in ,http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov, are provided ""as is"" for informational purposes only.
