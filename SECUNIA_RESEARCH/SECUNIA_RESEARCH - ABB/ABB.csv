","Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in ABB RobotWare, which can be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system and by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions and compromise a vulnerable system.

1) An error in the Robot Communication server can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.

2) Certain unspecified input is not properly sanitised before being used to execute commands. This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary commands.

3) The product does not properly restrict access to the robot controller, which can be exploited to bypass authentication.

4) An error in the FlexPendant can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.

5) An error in the command endpoint can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.
