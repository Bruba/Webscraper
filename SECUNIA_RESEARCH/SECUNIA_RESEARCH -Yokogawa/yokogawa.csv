","Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in multiple Yokogawa products, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and compromise a vulnerable system.

1) An unspecified error within the process that executes control over network communications can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via specially crafted packet.

2) Another unspecified error within the process that executes control over network communications can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via specially crafted packet.

3) Another unspecified error within the process that executes control over network communications can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via specially crafted packet.

"CVE-2005-2359
","Yukiyo Akisada has reported a security issue in FreeBSD, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions.

The problem is caused due to an implementation error in IPsec within the AES-XCBC-MAC authentication algorithm, which causes a constant key to be used for authentication instead of the administrator-defined key. This can potentially be exploited to spoof authentication packets from other IP addresses and bypass any IP-based access controls on the vulnerable system.

Successful exploitation requires encryption to be disabled.

The security issue has been reported in versions 5.3 and 5.4.",,ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-05:19.ipsec.asc,"Yukiyo Akisada, Yokogawa Electric Corporation.",2005-07-27,Update FreeBSD or apply patch.,FreeBSD IPsec AES-XCBC-MAC Authentication Security Issue
